# palindrome birthday

- Take your user's birthday
- Tell whether user was born on a palindrome day or not. 
- You can put dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY format etc. to check if they have any chance. 
- If not, then tell them what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date. 
     - Tell them by how many days they missed it.
     
## bonus

- show a gif when you're doing the calculation to show that numbers are being crunched.
- problem with this is that it will not slow your computer, explore setTimeout in JS to produce an artificial delay.
